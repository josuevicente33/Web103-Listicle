## Notes

One of the biggest issues I faced was the styling of the website and I don't think I got to the point that I wanted. Understanding PicoCss was a challenge but I think I was able to overcome it and use it as my advantage. I was unware that is provided its own styles as I thought it was more like tailwind. I was able to utilize PicoCss for their containers, grids, and buttons. Overall, the project was very useful with many moving parts, and I had fun with it.
